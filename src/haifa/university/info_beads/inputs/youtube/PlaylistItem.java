/**
 * A playlistItem resource identifies another resource, such as a video, that is included in a
 * playlist. In addition, the playlistItem  resource contains details about the included resource
 * that pertain specifically to how that resource is used in that playlist.
 *
 * YouTube uses playlists to identify special collections of videos for a channel, such as:   -
 * uploaded videos  - favorite videos  - positively rated (liked) videos  - watch history  - watch
 * later  To be more specific, these lists are associated with a channel, which is a collection of a
 * person, group, or company's videos, playlists, and other YouTube information.
 *
 * You can retrieve the playlist IDs for each of these lists from the  channel resource  for a given
 * channel. You can then use the   playlistItems.list method to retrieve any of those lists. You can
 * also add or remove items from those lists by calling the   playlistItems.insert and
 * playlistItems.delete methods. For example, if a user gives a positive rating to a video, you
 * would insert that video into the liked videos playlist for that user's channel.
