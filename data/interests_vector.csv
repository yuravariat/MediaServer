A network of computers configured to coordinate on computing problems is also called a <i>cluster</i>. Parallel computers can run some types of programs far faster than traditional single processor computers, often termed the von Neumann architecture. Programs that work on a single-processor computer don't automatically work on a parallel computer. Programmers must explicitly specify how to divide up the computing work between all available <i>nodes</i>. Information about writing programs especially for parallel computers is in <a href='/Computers/Parallel_Computing/Programming/'>Parallel_Computing/Programming</a>.

At a slightly higher level, these codes correspond to <em>assembly language</em>, short mnemonics for individual computer operations, that still correspond one to one with what the machine actually does. This is still unstructured, terse, and difficult to read or write in. Most programming is done in higher level, <em>compiled</em> languages, or even <em>interpreted</em> that look like a cross between English and Algebra, and allow various abstractions depending on the language, such as encapsulation, function calls, data hiding, and more, to enable people reading and writing programs to deal with the vast quantity of information that the computer actually handles.

According to the Syrius Cybernetics Corporation of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a robot is 'your plastic pal who's fun to be with'. A more conventional definition is, 'A mechanical device that sometimes resembles a human and is capable of performing a variety of often complex human tasks'. There are many other definitions, some a bit too narrow and some far too broad. We try to be as inclusive as possible, accepting sites about hobby robotics, industrial robotics, even those about the radio-controlled entertainment vehicles of 'Robot Wars'. Enjoy our selections. And if you don't agree with some of our choices, rest easy in the knowledge that someone else out there wouldn't agree with yours."

Evolution is the process by which living things change over generations. Evolutionary biology is the study of how and why evolution occurs. An organism inherits traits from its parents through the genome. Mutations in these genes and/or the way they are read, or not read, can produce a new trait in the offspring. If a new trait makes these offspring better suited to their environment, they will be more successful at surviving and reproducing. This process is called natural selection, and it causes useful traits to become more common. The theory of evolution by natural selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin in his book “On the Origin of Species”, written in 1859."

The discipline dates to antiquity, mainly as a scientific approach to earthquake prediction (a problem still unsolved), but major progress began in the late 1500s with initial work in such areas as magnetism and gravity. Tremendous improvements in instrumentation in the early years of the 20th century generated rapid progress in geophysics and ultimately led, in the 1960s, to the theory of plate tectonics. Plate tectonics, the study of the interior structure of the earth, and such related areas as global and regional processes are known collectively as solid earth geophysics. The subdiscipline known as exploration geophysics involves the use of geophysical theory and instrumentation to locate petroleum and other mineral sources. Unlike solid earth geophysics, exploration geophysics generally concentrates on finding lateral heterogeneities in a relatively small part of the earth's crust. Geophysics is considered by some to be a branch of geology, by others to be of equal rank. It is distinguished from the other earth sciences largely by its use of instruments to make direct or indirect measurements of the parts of the Earth being studied, in contrast to the more direct observations which are typical of geology. The following definitions are from Robert E. Sheriff's Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics. 1. The study of the earth by quantitative physical method, especially by seismic reflection and refraction, gravity, magnetic, electrical, electromagnetic, and radioactivity methods. 2. The application of physical principles to studies of the earth. Includes the branches of (a) seismology (earthquakes and elastic waves); (b) geothermometry (heating of the earth, heat flow, volcanology, and hot springs); (c) hydrology (ground and surface water, sometimes including glaciology); (d) physical oceanography; (e) meteorology; (f) gravity and geodesy (the earth's gravitational field and the size and form of the earth); (g) atmospheric electricity and terrestrial magnetism (including ionosphere, Van Allen belts, telluric currents, etc.); (h) tectonophysics (geological processes in the earth); and (i) exploration and engineering geophysics. Geochronology (the dating of earth history) and geocosmogony (the origin of the earth) are sometimes added to the foregoing list. 3. Often refers to solid-earth geophysics only, thus excluding (c), (d), (e), and portions of other subjects from the above list. 4. Exploration geophysics is the use of seismic, gravity, magnetic, electrical, electromagnetic, etc., methods in the search for oil, gas, minerals, water, etc., with the objective of economic exploitation."

Fractals are said to possess infinite detail, and are generally self-similar and independent of scale. In many cases a fractal can be generated by a repeating pattern, typically a recursive or iterative process. The term fractal was coined in 1975 by Benoît Mandelbrot, from the Latin fractus or 'broken'/'fraction'. Chaos theory, in mathematics and physics, deals with the behavior of certain nonlinear dynamical systems that (under certain conditions) exhibit the phenomenon known as chaos, most famously characterised by sensitivity to initial conditions. Systems that exhibit mathematical chaos are deterministic and thus orderly in some sense; this technical use of the word chaos is at odds with common parlance, which suggests complete disorder."

Computer algorithms have also been used to solve some seemingly intractable combinatorial problems. Conversely, combinatorial methods have been used successfully to solve problems in many areas of mathematics and computer science. Here is a sample problem that would use combinatorics: Strangers and Acquaintances (F.P.

This makes it particularly appropriate for small communities as it can be played in village halls, schools, sports and social clubs, hotels etc. where space is restricted and is also required for other purposes: it is even played on North Sea oil rigs where space is really at a premium. The foam-backed rink mats range from a minimum length of 40ft to a maximum of 45ft. The width is 6ft. The game is played in broadly the same way, and provides the same enjoyment and has the same attractions as outdoor bowls. The object is for each player in a singles game or each team in a pairs, triples or fours to gain as many shots as possible by getting their bowls nearer to the jack than their opponents. The bowls themselves, and the smooth soled heel less footwear are the same as those used outdoors. The presence of the block, which prevents players from playing with force directly towards an opponents bowl in order to knock it out of a scoring position, and the narrow playing area, requires players to develop skill in using the natural bias on the bowls to bowl round the block."

Among the principles espoused was the need to train the horse as a war horse, including all the intricate movements necessary to assist the rider while fighting in close quarters. By necessary, these movements had to be precise and immediate, no matter where the horse was at any particular moment or time, or the soldier risked forfeit of his life. With training, these movements became more rigorously defined, building to a level of detail and precision that often required years of study for both horse and rider to develop and hone. <p>The ancients may have set the stage for an enduring partnership between the horse and humanity, but it was the French, as great exponents of this art, who were the first to coin it 'dressage'. <p> Although the horse no longer participates in the battlefields as it did in the past, the Dressage arts have moved to a higher level in the world of sports, advancing it world-wide on many levels -- from local beginner to international Olympic.

The advanced military machinery of World War I, however, quickly (and utterly) destroyed forever the use of the horse in modern warfare. Nonetheless, the cavalry training methods refused to die. Still sponsored by the Olympic committee, they gradually migrated their way out of the military agenda, to be warmly received by the civilian equestrian community. <p>The sport continues to be enjoyed on an international level, and is practiced by all levels - from novice to advanced, pony clubber to Olympian, from simple day events to the all-encompassing three-day.

A polocrosse team consists of six players, divided into two sections of three who play alternate chukkas of a maximum of eight minutes each, either six or eight chukkas usually comprising a full match. The three players in each section consist of a No. I or 'Attack', a No. 2 or 'Mid-Field', and No. 3 or 'Defense'. Teams score goals by throwing the ball through the opposition's goal posts. At the same time, they protect their goal from the other team. All players can catch, carry and throw the ball with their racquets. However, only the player at the number 1 position is allowed to score. The rules are designed with one primary concern, safety -- for player and horse.

Players' performances in actual NFL games are translated into points to determine a final result for your team and your opponent. Scoring systems vary, with some systems penalizing your team for turnovers, giving up a lot of points, and so on, while others only work with the 'positive' statistics. Some Fantasy Football players still use pencil and paper and exchange telephone calls to make roster changes and the morning paper for their statistics. However, there are legions of new fans who are using one of the many on-line services that take care of all of the number-crunching for you and allow you to play against other fans from around the world. Please note: Games in which you choose the winner of each game, whether for free or pay-to-play, straight-up or against the spread, will be found in <a href='/Games/Gambling/Sports'>Games: Gambling: Sports</a>."

The offense must move the ball, by passing or running, ten yards in four plays ('downs') towards the opponent's goal line in an attempt to score. If the line is crossed, they score 'touchdown,' worth six points; otherwise, possession is yielded; scoring and possession may be accomplished through various additional means depending on the rules of the game in question. Kicking games were practiced in pre-colonial and colonial times under various rules. The first intercollegiate matchup took place on November 6, 1869 between Princeton and Rutgers Universities, but the distinctive rules of American football developed from the merging of the soccer-like rules adopted by Princeton, Rutgers, Yale and Columbia with those of the rugby-like running game observed by Harvard and McGill in the 1870s and 1880s."

Two teams take part in a game of rugby league with 13 players on each team at 'kick off'. Each team also have 4 substitutes/replacements available to bring on at any appropriate moment in the game.

The goal of a grappler is to make an opponent submit, or give up. This is usually achieved by means of joint locks, compressions, and chokes. If the opponent doesn't give up once a submission move has 'sunk in,' they will quickly become incapacitated, either because they are unconscious or have a broken limb. All moves when done with correct form should rely mainly on leverage, and not brute strength-- although strength does help. One often-used technique in grappling is tiring the opponent by making them work as hard as possible, without one's self becoming too tired. This method makes it easier to bring an opponent into submission."

During some eras it flourished and other times it diminished, according to the political, economic or cultural environment. The art was known by various names throughout the eras as Hwa Rang Do, Moo Sul, Kyuck Too Ki, Soo Bahk Ki, Soo Byuck Ki, and Taek Kyun respectively. Following Korea's independence in 1945 the Korean martial arts were again merged and flourished throughout the entire Korean Peninsula. Many organizations were founded with various names such as Soo Bahk Do, Tang Soo Do, and Tae Soo Do. At the beginning of the modern era of Korean martial arts, Tang Soo Do was the most popular term for these arts. However, at that time, the Korean political leader was concerned about establishing Korean values based on Korean nationalism. The political leaders recognized the popularity of Korean martial arts around the world, but were opposed to the use of the name Tang Soo Do for the art as it sounded like a Chinese martial art. The first word 'Tang' could be interpreted as representing the Chinese Tang Dynasty (617-907 AD). In 1964, a small government-sponsored group created a new name for the Korean martial arts, Tae Kwon Do."

There is however a rich history of weapons and unarmed combat training and methods that trace back to ancient Western civilizations. Modern boxing, fencing, and even wrestling have roots in older martial forms. Western or 'Occidental' describes cultures stemming from the Greco-Roman, Celtic and Germanic traditions, and the lands those cultures historically dominated. Typically, this would include Europe and the Americas. A marked difference between Oriental and Occidental martial arts is the general Occidental mind set in terms of the time to train and learn new martial skills. The Occidental instructor's mind set appears very different from those of the Oriental instructor's mindset, in that the Occidental instructor is not concerned with deep ritual or ceremony that are often, an integral part of the Oriental martial arts. Occidental students expect their Masters to provide systematic and effective knowledge, that has immediate application. Given the rapidity of the growing numbers of western-oriented martial arts groups and schools, the indication is evident that technique and the ability to learn a new skills quickly are the biggest draw for western martial arts schools today.

Racewalkers compete in races on oval tracks that range in size from 200m to 400m in races ranging in distance usually between 1500m and 5000m in length. Racewalking is not only for those that want to compete at an international level. It is also an extremely effective way to exercise for weightloss, getting fit, or for those that wish to compete locally or nationally. There are several clubs located throughout the world that were created especially for racewalking, and most are willing (if not eager) to accept new people into the sport. And with racewalking, which is not the case with most other sports, age is not a factor in being able to compete. Athletes as young as 5 to as mature as 99+ can and do compete in this sport."
